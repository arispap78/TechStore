This is the project i worked on for my Thesis.The aim of the project is to create an application for a desktop computer, which will be used to provide the services of a store with electronics products and gadgets and to make sales and orders.For the integration of the application were used all the required stages, the analysis, the design, the implementation and the control of the system.
For the analysis, the methodology of use cases was used, the diagram of them was designed and a detailed description of each use case was made.Afterwards, the entity-relationship model of the system was analyzed and designed. In the design phase, robustness diagrams and sequence diagrams were designed for each of the Use Cases.In the end, the Class diagram was made, which was based on the previous diagrams and it was the basis for the production of the code. At the implementation stage, the code of the program was written in the Java programming language based in the architecture of MVC-Model View Controller model.The function of the application is described in detail and the results of the integration of each use case are shown and described in detail with images step by step. Finally, the Framework JUnit 4 was used for the control of the units of the code.
The application is connected to a MYSQL database and performs functions such as registration and connection of a user, the search of products from the database and display their features, adding or removing products of the database, create and store a sale, create and store an order, search of a sale or an order, as well as display statistics for a selected time period
